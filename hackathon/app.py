    Welcome to the 2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge project. Use the pages in the sidebar to:

    - Inspect individual publications and their citation neighbourhoods.
    - Search the corpus semantically using OpenAlex metadata.
        - Ask grounded questions about the retrieved papers in the chatbot.

    Suggested workflow:

    1. Open *Publication Explorer* to cache metadata for the papers you're interested in.
    2. Jump to *Semantic Search* to discover related work with embedding similarity.
    3. Explore relationships in *Citation Graph* or ask questions in *Chatbot*.
